The class was very interesting
I liked the dynamics that was first theoretical and then practical, without a doubt I believe that the topics seen in class are totally useful for the business area, we faced various challenges such as programming and it was also difficult the fact that the subject was taught in English.
But I think the teacher helped a lot by being very patient and having a good teaching method where you see theory and then practice, in general the class was very good since it was a very interesting class and that it was taught in the best way by the teacher.
